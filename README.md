## In-Silico Study of Insulin-Related Genes and Their Role in PCOS

This repository contains my independently conducted bioinformatics research thesis:

"A Study on Insulin-Related Genes and Their Variants: In-Silico Insights into Their Systemic Impacts Beyond Glucose Metabolism"

---

## Abstract

This project investigates the pathogenicity and systemic impacts of variants in key insulin-related genes — including INS, INSR, PPARG, AKT2, and FOXP3 — in the context of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Using in-silico prediction tools, this research highlights potential gene-disease interactions affecting the immune, reproductive, and nervous systems.
